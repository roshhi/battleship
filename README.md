# Battleship Game

The Battleship game challenges players to strategically position their ships on a grid and take turns firing at their opponent’s hidden fleet. The objective is simple: **sink all enemy ships before they sink yours**.

This version features a clean UI, responsive layout, and modular architecture, making it both enjoyable to play and easy to maintain or extend.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roshhi/battleship.git
cd battleship
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm run start
```
Runs the game locally using **Webpack Dev Server**.  
Once started, visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to play.

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Generates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

## How It Works

- Players place ships dynamically using drag-and-drop.
- The grid system is generated and updated through DOM manipulation.
- Game logic (hit detection, turn switching, win condition) is handled in `gameFunctions.js`.
- Audio feedback (hits, misses, explosions) enhances gameplay immersion.

---

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with hit/miss logic  
- Dynamic ship placement around both axis x and y
- Sound effects for actions  
- Responsive design for multiple screen sizes  
- Modular architecture with reusable components  
- Webpack setup for efficient builds and hot reloading
